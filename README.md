# MinnPost Mailchimp Salesforce Sync

This is a Salesforce app that syncs Mailchimp subscribers with
Salesforce contacts. It can map fields between the two in either
direction, filling in Mailchimp \*|MERGE|* fields with Salesforce
contact data, or pulling Mailchimp attributes into Salesforce Contact
records.
